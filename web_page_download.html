          When you search for a specific wedpage the internet browser that your useing sends a HTTP GET request to 
          the wedpages server that your looking at. The request that is sent have information that the servers need 
          like the requested URL and the type of request like GET or POST. 
         
        <li><h4> 2. Receiving the Request on the Server </h4></li>
